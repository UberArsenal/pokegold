# Pokémon True Gold v0.78a Change Log

## Core Gameplay Rebalances

### Base Stat & Typing Updates
- **Aipom** receives a full offensive tune-up (65/95/70/105/65/60) and becomes Normal/Dark to emphasize ambush play. 
- **Spinarak & Ariados** now fight as Bug/Dark specialists, giving the line better defensive pivots while keeping their 40/60/40/30/40/40 and 70/90/70/40/60/60 spreads intact.
- **Girafarig** now leans harder into speed and special defense (70/80/65/90/90/80), making dual screens practical.
- **Murkrow** gets sturdier defenses (70/85/66/91/85/66) without losing its speed edge.
- **Sunflora** gains a Fire secondary typing atop its 75/75/55/30/105/85 stats for Solar-based offense.
- **Yanma** evolves into a Bug/Dragon glass cannon with 75/75/66/95/100/55 stats.

### Move Set Revisions
- **Early-game physicals**: Mega Punch is now Fighting-type, Vice Grip shifts to Bug, and Fury Attack becomes a Flying multi-hit to diversify coverage.
- **Grass toolkit**: Vine Whip rises to 40 BP, Absorb and Mega Drain jump to 40/65 BP, and Petal Dance is buffed to 120 BP.
- **Bug staples**: Twineedle hits for 30 BP per strike, Pin Missile jumps to 20 BP, and Leech Life is upgraded to 60 BP lifesteal.
- **Elemental reworks**: SonicBoom converts to a 60 BP Electric strike that can paralyze, Dragon Rage becomes a 70 BP Dragon attack with burn chance, and Rage itself is now Dragon-type.
- **Heavy hitters**: Hyper Beam is retuned into a 150 BP Dragon finisher while Grass’ SolarBeam and Fire Blast retain top billing for the starters.

### Learnset & Level Curve Adjustments
- **Chikorita line** adopts a drain-centric curve: Giga Drain at 31, Light Screen at 37, and Petal Dance → Safeguard → SolarBeam capping the line.
- **Cyndaquil line** becomes a late-game flamethrower: Fire Punch arrives at 36, Flamethrower at 46, Fire Blast at 54, and Sacred Fire as the final prize (Lv. 70–75 depending on stage).
- **Totodile line** leans bruiser: Bite at 19, Crunch at 31, Waterfall at 35, Ice Punch at 43, and Hydro Pump as a high-level payoff.

## Encounters & Progression
- **Sprout Tower 2F/3F** welcome nighttime Misdreavus encounters to ease early Ghost acquisition.
- **Tin Tower** floors broaden nocturnal rosters with Hoothoot, Noctowl, Misdreavus, and Haunter while maintaining Raticate patrols by day.
- **Burned Tower** floors mix in Growlithe, Vulpix, Magnemite, Houndour, Slugma, and Magmar for a deliberate Fire/Dark ecosystem split.
- **National Park (Gold)** guarantees Yanma slots alongside both Caterpie and Weedle families for Bug-Catching variety.
- **Johto Safari Zone draft** introduces a 500-step/30-ball ruleset with full inventory cleanup, new out-of-time/out-of-balls fail states, and stub warps back to the gate.

## Trainer & Battle Tuning
- **Gym Leaders**
  - Falkner now opens with Natu and Hoothoot before a Confusion-enabled Noctowl.
  - Whitney fields Clefairy, Baton Pass Furret, and the classic Miltank, all scripted for item play.
  - Bugsy runs an itemized Ledian, Heracross, Yanma, and Scyther.
  - Morty expands to a four-mon spectral squad featuring Pain Split Misdreavus.
  - Chuck, Jasmine, Pryce, and Clair all wield full competitive-grade parties with held items, coverage moves, and thematic rosters.
- **Rival**
  - Cherrygrove City’s first duel is now a scripted ambush with can-lose logic and an ID-theft vignette.
  - Subsequent encounters add Magnemite, Haunter evolutions, Sneasel, Magneton, Kadabra, and fully-evolved starters by the Goldenrod and Victory Road arcs.

## Narrative & Event Enhancements
- **Elm’s Lab investigation** adds an officer debrief sequence, Elm gratitude, and window flavor text that sells the break-in.
- **Cherrygrove aftermath** extends the rival confrontation with new movements, interrogation dialogue, and automatic party healing before you proceed.

## Quality-of-Life Systems
- **Party menu overlays** now dynamically show TM/HM compatibility, evolution stone eligibility, and gender markers when choosing targets.
- **TM/Evo item logic** surfaces “ABLE / NOT ABLE” readouts without opening the status screen.
- **Safari session management** cleanly issues balls, tracks steps via a MAPCALLBACK hook, and clears remaining Safari Balls upon exit for consistent state.
